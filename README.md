### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

Simple mistakes like forgetting to modify the estimate size of my collection view. Spent alot more time than I should have on this part of the instructions. Other than that, there were no major challenges.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

Just as the Prework assignment, the instructions were really self-explanatory. The real challenge was due to technical issues. My laptop was not booting up correctly and was spending the majority of my time troubleshooting. For this part, I was only able to complete a functional movie app with no poster images.
