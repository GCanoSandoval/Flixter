### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

Just as the Prework assignment, the instructions were really self-explanitory. The real challenge was due to technical issues. My laptop was not booting up correctly and was spending the majority of my time troubleshooting. For this part, I was only able to complete a functional movie app with no poster images.
